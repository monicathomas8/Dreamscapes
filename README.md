Models follow Django conventions and make use of **relational fields** to maintain data integrity.

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Please follow here for the [`ERD.md`](ERD.md) file.

## Testing

DreamScapes was tested thoroughly using a combination of manual testing, validator tools, test-driven development (TDD), and behavior-driven development (BDD) based on user stories.

### 1. Manual Testing

All core features were manually tested for correct behavior and usability. This included:

- Navigation bar and footer links
- Page responsiveness on different screen sizes
- Form validation (login, signup, shipping, custom orders)
- Flash messages (success/error feedback)
- Stripe payment flow and order confirmation

Test cases and results are documented in the [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) file.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

Key functionality was implemented using user stories with BDD-style acceptance criteria and scenarios. These included:

- Viewing artwork details  
- Adding and removing items from the cart  
- Submitting and managing custom artwork requests  
- Completing a purchase with valid delivery and payment information  
- Viewing past orders from the user dashboard

Examples of user stories and corresponding BDD scenarios are also included in [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md).

### 3. Validators

All templates were passed through:

- [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- Python code was validated with [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) via the flake8 tool.

# Bugs & Fixes

This section outlines bugs encountered during development and how they were resolved.

| Bug ID | Description | Status | Fix |
|--------|-------------|--------|-----|
| 1 | **Navbar collapsing issue on smaller screens.** The hamburger icon appeared but links weren't visible. | âœ… Fixed | Added `navbar-toggler` and ensured correct `data-bs-*` attributes were in place. Verified with Bootstrap 5 docs. |
| 2 | **Delivery details not saving correctly.** Form submitted but data wasn't stored. | âœ… Fixed | Reordered logic to save shipping details before Stripe intent was created. Confirmed correct form validation. |
| 3 | **Background image not loading.** No visual update on home page despite styling. | âœ… Fixed | Realized `DEBUG` was `False` during development, preventing static files from updating. Switched it on to see changes. |
| 4 | **Footer not sticking to bottom.** Footer floated mid-screen on short content pages. | âœ… Fixed | Used flexbox with `min-height: 100vh` and `flex-direction: column` on `body`, and `mt-auto` on the footer. |
| 5 | **Cart not updating correctly.** Removing an item didnâ€™t update the total price. | âœ… Fixed | Corrected cart logic in the view and ensured session was updated after item deletion. |
| 6 | **Order Detail page causing 500 error.** Clicking an order broke the page. | âœ… Fixed | Caused by missing `artwork_detail` URL in loop link. Wrapped in an `if artwork` condition and fixed the template path. |
| 7 | **404 page not connected.** Broken links redirected to default Django 404. | âœ… Fixed | Created a custom `404.html` template and updated `handler404` in `urls.py`. |
| 8 | **Custom order form validation errors not displaying.** Users saw no feedback. | âœ… Fixed | Added `form.errors` block in template and used `{{ form.field.errors }}` per field. |
| 9 | **Logged-out users accessing protected routes.** Users could manually enter profile URLs and access restricted pages. | âœ… Fixed | Added `@login_required` decorators and checks in views for authenticated users. |
| 10 | **Stripe card element not rendering.** The form appeared blank on the checkout page. | âœ… Fixed | Script was loading before the DOM was ready. Moved Stripe script to bottom of page and ensured JS loaded after elements. |
| 11| **Help text triggering ARIA validation errors.** `aria-describedby` pointed to non-existent IDs. | âœ… Fixed | Manually added matching `<small id="...">` elements below each input or removed the attribute where unused. |
| 12 | **Profile update form not saving changes.** Users saw no errors but info didnâ€™t change. | âœ… Fixed | Overwrote the `__init__()` method incorrectly. Updated logic to use `instance=request.user` properly in view. |
| 13 | **Mobile menu overlapping page content.** Navbar dropdown remained open and obscured page content. | âœ… Fixed | Added `z-index` and closed mobile menu on link click using JavaScript. |
| 14 | **New users couldnâ€™t sign up.** Form submitted but account wasnâ€™t created, and no error was shown. | âœ… Fixed | Added error handling and checked that the registration view was saving the user correctly. Ensured form used `UserCreationForm` and included required fields in `forms.py`. |
| 15 | **Product images not displaying on deployed site.** Thumbnails broken on Heroku. | âœ… Fixed | Adjusted `Cloudinary` settings and ensured `MEDIA_URL` and `CloudinaryStorage` were correctly configured. |

## Deployment

- **International Shipping**: Expand shipping beyond the UK to reach a global customer base.
- **Live Artwork Customization Preview**: Allow users to see a visual mock-up of their custom order before submission.
- **User Behavior Analytics**: Implement advanced tracking to monitor user interactions and optimize UX.
- **Image Watermarking**: Apply watermarks to artwork previews to prevent unauthorized use prior to purchase.


## Summary

DreamScapes is the result of a rewarding yet challenging journey, where technical precision met artistic expression to create a unique e-commerce platform. The project was shaped by tight time constraints and unforeseen hurdles, demanding creative problem-solving and adaptability throughout the process.
